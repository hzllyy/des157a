    <h1>Final Project Brief</h1>

    <h3>Project Summary</h3>
    <p>For my final project, I plan on improving my Game On! project. Although I haven't gotten very far on my game yet, I chose this project because my plans for the game are a little more complex than my other projects, and would love the extra time to refine it. I am also pretty satisfied with the results of my other two projects, and don't feel a level of connection with them that would motivate me to continue working on them.</p>

    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <p>For my Game On project, I hope to create a game that is different from the Game of Pig but still uses some of the principles required for the base game. I was thinking of creating a game that follows the guidelines of Rock Paper Scissors, in the form of a card game. It would use the same techniques as the Pig Game for random generation and score counting, and only really differ in the way turns are set up. For my final project, I would like to include extra pages to this game, including a tutorial page, a menu page, and and avatar picking game. Therefore, my focus will be improving the design of the overall game.</p>

    <h3>Expert Feedback</h3>
    <p>In terms of expert feedback, I plan on asking the class undergrad design tutor as well as my sister, who works professionally as a UI/UX designer.</p>
