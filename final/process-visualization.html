    <h1>Final Project Process Visualization</h1>
    <img src="images/Game On!.png" alt="game-on">
    <p>For my final project, I decided to tweak the visual design of my game a little further. I decided to add a prior page that allows the user to select an avatar, which will affect the odds of the cards that they are dealt. I also decided to add a few more elements to the original game, including graying out the cards that have already been selected, and adding a border around the deck to let the user know when they should draw new cards. I also decided to get rid of the purple color component, as I felt that it did not blend well with the rest of the page. I hope that through these changes, the game objectives will be clearer to the user.</p>
