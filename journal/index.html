        <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f"><em>Best Practices for Form Design</em></a> by Salim Ansari delves into the inner workings of a UI creator's brain when tackling form design. The author goes into great detail of every aspect of a form, explaining the most effective methods to maintainig a user's attention through thoughtful planning. This article does an excellent job dissecting the reasoning behind every design choice, down to what kind of keyboards to display, and the type of language that should be used when communicating with the user.</p>

        <p>As someone who frequents online shopping, a form that I recently filled out that popped into my mind is the mobile check-out form for <a href="https://www.depop.com/">Depop</a>, a second-hand seller site. I've always found myself purchasing from the app before I register my poor financial decisions, and so the UX of the design has proven effective to me on multiple occasions. Studying their check-out page, I noticed that it is extremely concise, as once you have filled out information like your name and address in the past, it autofills for future purchases. Another aspect that makes it even more convenient is the option to pay with Apple Pay, as you don't need to feel the stress of entering in your long winded credit card information.</p>
