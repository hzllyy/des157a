        <p>Amir Dori's article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099"><em>Game Design UX Best Practices</em></a> was something I thought would be a cool read, but lowkey sucked. I liked the beginning, where it goes over the ideal UI positions for buttons, but that is generally where my enjoyment stopped.</p>

        <p>I understand that he has created a lot of successful games, but this article really felt more like "Best Practices on How to Get Children to Spend Money" rather than game design best practices. It was a whole lot about button placement to get the user to make as many purchases as possible, or how to get them to watch more ads, or how to convince them to give their app a good review. There was not much on the game itself.</p>

        <p>This knowledge is sound for the realm of mobile games, but as for games that can be purchased off steam or similar consoles/platforms, this advice is not applicable. In my opinion, bomboarding the user with all these ads and purchasing options just kills the enjoyment of the game.</p>

        <h3>Part I</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/daddy.jpg" alt="me-and-daddy" width="380" height="410">
            <figcaption>Holly Zheng, 2007</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>I think something interesting about this picture is that it is a picture of a picture, which is definitely something you wouldn't notice unless you looked carefully at the edges of the picture. It was taken before we could take pictures with our iPhones, which emphasizes the idea of this picture being very early on in my life.</p>

        <p>This image relates to my topic because I want my topic to discuss how my loved ones had influenced me and my art, whether it was directly or indirectly. I especially wanted to use the image of my father, because he is a very logical man who knows nothing about art, but he still unknowingly shaped my artistic talent at a very young age. This archive allows me to dive into my inspirations that stem from beyond myself, but rather the world around me.</p>

        <h3>Part II</h3>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/kim.jpg" alt="kims-image" width="300" height="400">
            <figcaption>Kim Luong, 2024</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Kim's image that she presented shows off her outfit as she is looking down at her bag. What really stands out to me about this image is how the softness of her clothes, in both color and texture, stands in stark contrast to the bright purple backdrop that is covered in graffitti. She looks very put together and elegant, but her surroundings seem worn down, with chips in the paint and hard concrete below her.</p>

        <p>I think the most obvious part of the image is the contrast, because it is so blatant it is hard to not notice. I think a mysterious part is trying to follow the line of her eyes, whether she is looking at her hand or her keychain, and why.</p>

        <p>Michael Gonchar's article <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/"><em>10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</em></a> was an intriguing read. It was ironic, because I came into the article planning on skimming through it as fast as possible, but was forced to slow down upon uncovering its subject matter.</p>

        <p>I think that Gonchar's recommended exercises prove extremely effective in encouraging students to slow down and become more observant. This is such an important skill to learn, as media literacy has been dipping lately, and so has the presentation of complex media. It seems that with this new era of fast-paced gratification, the general public is losing their ability to read in between the lines.</p>

        <p>All the selected images in the article were extremely compelling, and fulfills their purpose in forcing the viewer to pause and wonder what the image is portraying. I hope that more people continue to push back against our shortening attention spans and encourage future generations to become more observant of the world around them.</p>

        <p>Upon reading the article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c"><em>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</em></a> by Naema Baskanderi, it really got me thinking about how I view and interact with modal elements. Until that moment, I had never noticed how pop ups caused me stress and triggered the instinct to immediately get rid of them, which led me to examine the reasoning behind this feeling.</p>

        <p>I came to the conclusion that not only do the sudden motion of a pop up indeed grab a user's attention, it also makes me feel as though it is cluttering my laptop. As someone who likes to have as little tabs running on a browser at a time, modals can be tricky to deal with. I appreciated the advice Baskanderi provided about keeping modals simple and short, yet descriptive, as this would really help minimize stress.</p>

        <p>Overall, I found Baskanderi's article to be informative and filled with great tips to keep our modal designs as efficient as possible. It is filled with insightful tips for aspiring UX designers.</p>

        <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f"><em>Best Practices for Form Design</em></a> by Salim Ansari delves into the inner workings of a UI creator's brain when tackling form design. The author goes into great detail of every aspect of a form, explaining the most effective methods to maintainig a user's attention through thoughtful planning. This article does an excellent job dissecting the reasoning behind every design choice, down to what kind of keyboards to display, and the type of language that should be used when communicating with the user.</p>

        <p>As someone who frequents online shopping, a form that I recently filled out that popped into my mind is the mobile check-out form for <a href="https://www.depop.com/">Depop</a>, a second-hand seller site. I've always found myself purchasing from the app before I register my poor financial decisions, and so the UX of the design has proven effective to me on multiple occasions. Studying their check-out page, I noticed that it is extremely concise, as once you have filled out information like your name and address in the past, it autofills for future purchases. Another aspect that makes it even more convenient is the option to pay with Apple Pay, as you don't need to feel the stress of entering in your long winded credit card information.</p>
