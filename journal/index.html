        <p>Upon reading the article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c"><em>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</em></a> by Naema Baskanderi, it really got me thinking about how I view and interact with modal elements. Until that moment, I had never noticed how pop ups caused me stress and triggered the instinct to immediately get rid of them, which led me to examine the reasoning behind this feeling.</p>

        <p>I came to the conclusion that not only do the sudden motion of a pop up indeed grab a user's attention, it also makes me feel as though it is cluttering my laptop. As someone who likes to have as little tabs running on a browser at a time, modals can be tricky to deal with. I appreciated the advice Baskanderi provided about keeping modals simple and short, yet descriptive, as this would really help minimize stress.</p>

        <p>Overall, I found Baskanderi's article to be informative and filled with great tips to keep our modal designs as efficient as possible. It is filled with insightful tips for aspiring UX designers.</p>

        <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f"><em>Best Practices for Form Design</em></a> by Salim Ansari delves into the inner workings of a UI creator's brain when tackling form design. The author goes into great detail of every aspect of a form, explaining the most effective methods to maintainig a user's attention through thoughtful planning. This article does an excellent job dissecting the reasoning behind every design choice, down to what kind of keyboards to display, and the type of language that should be used when communicating with the user.</p>

        <p>As someone who frequents online shopping, a form that I recently filled out that popped into my mind is the mobile check-out form for <a href="https://www.depop.com/">Depop</a>, a second-hand seller site. I've always found myself purchasing from the app before I register my poor financial decisions, and so the UX of the design has proven effective to me on multiple occasions. Studying their check-out page, I noticed that it is extremely concise, as once you have filled out information like your name and address in the past, it autofills for future purchases. Another aspect that makes it even more convenient is the option to pay with Apple Pay, as you don't need to feel the stress of entering in your long winded credit card information.</p>
